# PoC: gnome-shell extension in TypeScript
See [SST issue](https://github.com/JoshKeegan/sst/issues/28). To improve that I wanted to do a PoC outside of SST, to focus on the TypeScript idea, not getting the SST code ported.

It works & you can install with `make clean install`. Then enable like any other gnome-extension.
